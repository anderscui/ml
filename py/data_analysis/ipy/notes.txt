P45
Act without doing, work without effort. Think of the small as large and the few as many. Confront the difficult while it is still easy; accomplish the great task by a series of small acts. The Master never reaches for the great; thus achieves greatness. (ch. 63)

为无为，事无事，味无味。
大小多少，报怨以德。
图难于其易，为大于其细。
天下难事，必作于易；天下大事，必作于细。

IPython project began in 2001 as Fernando Perez's side project to make a better interactive Python interpreter.

While it does not provide any computational or data analytical tools by itself, IPython is designed from the ground
up to maximize your productivity in both interactive computing and software development.

It encourages an execute-explore workflow instead of the typical edit-compile-run workflow.
